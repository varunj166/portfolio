I specialize in JavaScript/TypeScript on the front- and back-ends. I understand that no matter how much I know and learn about software development, what I <em>do</em> know will always be eclipsed by what I <em>don't</em> know. But what I don't know, I know how to learn.</p><p>Born and raised in Toronto, I struggled to find my calling after graduating university. Two years ago, after packing in my final attempt at making a living from electronic day-trading, I dove head-first into the world of software development, with a focus on web development. Having a good understanding of how best to learn new things, I knew the best way to start was by <strong>building a solid foundation</strong>.</p><p>I started with foundational computer science concepts to help me understand what the computer was up to under the hood, and how to measure the performance of executed code. I then applied this <strong>ground-up approach</strong> to every new concept and technology I encountered on my way to becoming a skilled web developer.</p><p>I truly enjoy encountering new technologies, new ways of thinking, and new approaches to solving problems with technology. I am constantly on the search to expand my knowledge and abilities, and to figure out new ways of <strong>providing value</strong> to end-users and potential employers.</p></section><section id="skills-section" class="inner-section display-none"><h1>Core Skill Set</h1><ul><li>HTML5</li><li>CSS3 + SASS</li><li>JavaScript (including ES2015+)</li><li>TypeScript</li><li>NodeJS + Express</li><li>React (including 16.8) + Redux</li><li>NoSQL (MongoDB)</li><li>SQL (MySQL)</li><li>Java SE 11</li><li>Android development (beginner)</li></ul><p><strong>Next Steps</strong> &mdash; Having completed a comprehensive course on Java SE, I have begun studying Android development with Android Studio.

The back-end was built with NodeJS using the Express framework, also written in TypeScript, behind a PM2 cluster.</p><p>I chose MongoDB as my database because of how well NoSQL plays with JavaScript, my knowledge of optimizing document stores, and for its easy horizontal scalability (sharding) should WeeWur grow to require such scaling.</p><p><strong>Particularly notable features include:</strong> highly scalable image and video processing, database caching layer with Redis, strong security measures (csrf and xss protection, rate limiting, one-way (salted) password hashing, CSP, etc.), real-time client-side notifications using Server Sent Events, mobile push notifications using the Push API, third-party OAuth integration, and client-side code-splitting.</p><p>I have commercial aspirations for WeeWur, so I cannot make my entire codebase available publicly, but I will be more than happy to talk about how I implemented any features of interest to you, and share code-snippets if requested.</p><p>If you wish to look around and try out the WeeWur platform, I have set up a dummy account that you can use:</p><p><strong>Username:</strong> <em>"full.stack659"</em> &mdash; <strong>Password:</strong> <em>"Demo1234"</em></p><p>Feel free to click around and upload photos and videos (you can delete them after).
